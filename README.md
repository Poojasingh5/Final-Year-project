<p align="center">Traffic Sign Detection and Classification in Real
Time<center/>
<br/>
  In this Project, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which is a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
  <br/>DataSet used in this project :
  <ul>
    <li>German Traffic Sign : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign </li>
    <li>
  Indian Hand Traffic Signs are also manually added in train folders. Add classes 43, 44 and 45 inside the train folder.
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <br/>
<b> Prerequisites</b> 
This project requires prior knowledge of Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PIL, and image classification.<br/>

To install the necessary packages used for this Python data science project, enter the below command in your terminal:<br/>
## <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation<h2>
   ```
     Open command prompt:
   ```
```
pip install tensorflow keras sklearn matplotlib pandas pil
```
 
This code contains 
  <ul>
    <li> GUI Source Code 
      <br/>
      Run the gui.py file in VSCode for the user interface. It allows you to upload images and classify the sign as per the trained model.
    <li> Training Source Code 
      <br/>
      Run the traffic_sign.py file in VSCode for model training and metrics evaluation. It will run 15 epochs with batch size =32 for training and validation accuracy.
  <ul/>
